# To-Do List Before Merging to Main  (1 / 6)
[X] Make Toon-Up immune to tgtLvl/levelDropDown.
[ ] Make Toon-Up receive only half of trackExp/trackDropDown.

[ ] Make lured-ratio checkbox disabled unless a multi-target gag is used.
[ ] Create a way to indicate Wedding Cake/Geyser were used instead of single-target gags in their respective tracks (this may be a checkbox called "Multi-Target?").

[ ] Force the trackExp to impose a lower limit depending on the lure gag selected.

[ ] Only allow Toon-Up to benefit from 1 stun since only Doodles and SOSs come before it in turn order and SOS cards do not apply a stun. 

## Ideas/Thoughts:
- An interface could be developed which visually references the in-game gag menu, which would allow me greater ability in setting the trackExp lower limit without imposing a ludicrously long dropdown menu. This would likely involved a 7x7 table
