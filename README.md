#The Unofficial Toontown Rewritten Gag Accuracy Calculator

Hello! Welcome! This is a simple web project to calculate the accuracy of gags used in the video game Toontown Rewritten. Hypothetically, the work done here can be used to simulate situations that could occur in game, which means this project could impact individuals who like optimzing/planning while also serving as an educational tool to people new to the game/the specifics of the combat system.

It uses a couple of dropdown menus and checkboxes to record inputs from the user. 

This README commemorates me finally hitting an alpha stage with the project; each of the intended features can (almost) be fully used.
